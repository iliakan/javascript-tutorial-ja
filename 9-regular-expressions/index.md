# Regular expressions

Regular expressions is a powerful way of doing search and replace in strings.

In JavaScript regular expressions are implemented using objects of a built-in `RegExp` class and integrated with strings.

Please note that regular expressions vary between programming languages. In this tutorial we concentrate on JavaScript. Of course there's a lot in common, but they are a somewhat different in Perl, Ruby, PHP etc.
